#### Delete a folder (not empty)
```rmdir -rf ```    + "directory"

FYI: you can use letters -f, -r, -v:

-r: to remove directories and their contents recursively
-f: to ignore non-existent files, never prompt
-v: to explain what is being done

In Case *User doesnot have permission to delete the folder:*

su rmdir -rf
